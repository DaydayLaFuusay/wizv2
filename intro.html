                            In 2016, a phishing attack on the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign led to the leak of sensitive emails. The attackers used a fake Google security alert to gain access to the campaign chairman's email account. This incident highlights the importance of recognizing phishing tactics and the potential consequences of falling for such attacks.

                            In 2017, a massive phishing attack targeted Gmail users. The attackers disguised themselves as a trusted contact and tricked users into opening a fake Google Docs link, leading to the compromise of thousands of Gmail accounts. This incident underscores the need for robust phishing prevention measures even in widely used platforms like Gmail.
